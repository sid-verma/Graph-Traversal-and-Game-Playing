## Problem Statement: Graph Traversal
Problem Statement: The 8-puzzle problem can be represented by a tree where a single node represents the game state and the child nodes are next possible game states for each permissible move.  In order for the initial state to reach the solved state, 6 Graph traversal algorithms (BFS, DFS, IDS, Greedy Best First Search, A* and IDA*)  were considered and a comparative analysis of the traversal algorithms was carried out.
